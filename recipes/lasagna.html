    <h2>Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>This is <strong>my mom's special</strong> homemade lasagna 
        recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. 
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread</p>
